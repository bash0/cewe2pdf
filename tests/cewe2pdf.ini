   # To run with the locally installed cewe system and the franchise extras, comment out the 
   # two tests/ definitions below and add your own definition, eg
   # cewe_folder = C:\Program Files\Elkjop fotoservice_6.3\elkjop fotoservice

   # tests/Resources then contains a small extract of the data files normally found in the actual
   # installed cewe_folder, perhaps C:\Program Files\Elkjop fotoservice_6.3\elkjop fotoservice, just
   # enough for our tests to produce a halfway decent pdf.

   # tests/hps/<keyaccount> (where the keyaccount is defined in tests/Resources/config/keyaccount.xml)
   # contains a small extract of the additional data files normally found in the hps folder provided
   # by the particular franchise of the cewe system

# These explicit additions are no longer necessary after Christian Weike's improvements in July 2021
