# This file contains code to unpack an .mfcx album to the older format
# of an mcf file and a folder of images. An mfcx file is just a database
# with a single table, Files, where each row is a filename and a blob
# content for the file. We create a temporary directory and unpack all
# the files to there. One of these files is the .mcf file in exactly the
# format which we have used for previous versions.

# This code is basically taken from
# https://pynative.com/python-sqlite-blob-insert-and-retrieve-digital-data/#h-retrieve-image-and-file-stored-as-a-blob-from-sqlite-table
